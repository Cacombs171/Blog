  <h3>Week 7</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Monday, October 2<sup>nd</sup> 2017-</strong> Class started off like every other monday does. Class began with roll call. Everyone seemed to dred being in class. Next, Professor Picarri went over this weeks calender. After we reveiwed css, professor gave us the rest of the class to work on our resume projects. She also informed us that today was our last day to work on the projects in class. The time went by super slow and class seemed to last forever.</li>
    <li><strong>Tuesday, October 3<sup>rd</sup> 2017-</strong> I was ready for today. Today in class we started with a industrial presentation and I find them so fasinating. Today we had Ryan coome in and talk about:
      <ul>
        <li>What he does.</li>
        <li>How he got where he is.</li>
        <li>The poeple he has met. Exc...</li>
    </ul>
  Ryan's presentation lasted about 2 hours and 30 minutes. After Ryan left, we began to learn about responsive websites and how to make them compadable with other devices such as, desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones. After talking about it for a while, we practiced it on our resume websites until the end of class. At the end of class, professor reminded us that our projects had to be turned into the portal by 11:55pm or else we would receive a zero.</li>
    <li><strong>Wednesday, October 4<sup>th</sup> 2017-</strong> Class was a bit confusing today. After the professor did the normal roll call and daily schedule, we did a lab on responsive websites. It was very confusing because it was a guessing game. Mid way through class we paired up with the person next to us, trying to make their resume responsive. Once we finished one perosn's site, then we worked on the other perosn site. We did this up to the end of class. Before we left class, we discussed why we thought partner coding was better than coding by yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>Thursday, October 5<sup>th</sup> 2017-</strong> Professor Pricari cancelled class today.</li>
    <li><strong>Friday, October 6<sup>th</sup> 2017-</strong> Today was a fun coding day. Rafeal and I brought in treats for the class. He brought cookies and I brought lolipops. While we were embracing our sugar rushes, we watched 2 tech talks by Jerey and Zach. After they were both done, we had until 1:30pm to do some type of coding. At 1:30pm, we had another industrial presentation. Today we had Josh come in. He talked about:
    <ul>
      <li>His previous background</li>
      <li>His current job as a quality insurance.</li>
      <li>The hiring process. Exc...</li>
    </ul>
   Once he left, we went back to our individual coding. We continued to code until class ended. Today has been a good day.</li>

  <h3>Week 8</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Monday, October 9<sup>th</sup> 2017-</strong> Today we had no class because of it being a teacher in-service day.</li>
    <li><strong>Tuesday, October 10<sup>th</sup> 2017-</strong> Class times seems to be changing. We seem to be doing more independent work. Today in class, professor did a small lecture on sass. Once she finished, everyone had two options on what they would do unitl the end of class. Option one was we go onto code academy and practice sass through one of their courses or we use one of our files that we have coded twice already and apply sass into it. We did that until 10 minutes before class ended. During the last ten minutes of class, professor called on everyone in class to describe what they did during class today.</li>
    <li><strong>Wednesday, October 11<sup>th</sup> 2017-</strong> Today I learned that the school year is flying by. At the beginng of class, we were givin our midterm project. We started off going over it. The project will contain everything we gone over so far. After we finished discussing it, we had about 1 hour and 30 minutes to work on it which led up to the end of class.</li>
    <li><strong>Thurday, October 12<sup>th</sup> 2017-</strong> Today has been a great day. I love rainy days. So calm and pieceful. At the start of class, we did our first standing confrence within our groups. Once we finished, each person was to work on our midterm projects until 2pm. At 2pm, we went on our very first class "fieldtrip" to Make717. It was interesting seeing all of the machines they have. As cool as it seemed, I wouldn't be someone who would pay for it. After the tour ended, we went back to the classroom. For the rest of the time in class, we continued to work on our midterm projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Friday, October 13<sup>th</sup> 2017-</strong> I'm enjoying the time we get in class to work on our prjects. Today's class stated off with tech talks. Justin, Jessie, and David went today. After they went, we did a quick kahoot. I like kahoot but sometime its hard for me to see the bored in the back. Too many heads in the way. Once we finished, we continued to mess with our midterm project. We were stopped by another industrial presentation. Today we had Jared from Fulton Bank come in. His presentation contained...
