  <h3>Week 7</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Monday, October 2<sup>nd</sup> 2017-</strong> Class started off like every other monday does. Class began with roll call. Everyone seemed to dred being in class. Next, Professor Picarri went over this weeks calender. After we reveiwed css, professor gave us the rest of the class to work on our resume projects. She also informed us that today was our last day to work on the projects in class. The time went by super slow and class seemed to last forever.</li>
    <li><strong>Tuesday, October 3<sup>rd</sup> 2017-</strong> I was ready for today. Today in class we started with a industrial presentation and I find them so fasinating. Today we had Ryan coome in and talk about:
      <ul>
        <li>What he does.</li>
        <li>How he got where he is.</li>
        <li>The poeple he has met. Exc...</li>
    </ul>
  Ryan's presentation lasted about 2 hours and 30 minutes. After Ryan left, we began to learn about responsive websites and how to make them compadable with other devices such as, desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones. After talking about it for a while, we practiced it on our resume websites until the end of class. At the end of class, professor reminded us that our projects had to be turned into the portal by 11:55pm or else we would receive a zero.</li>
    <li><strong>Wednesday, October 4<sup>th</sup> 2017-</strong> Class was a bit confusing today. After the professor did the normal roll call and daily schedule, we did a lab on responsive websites. It was very confusing because it was a guessing game. Mid way through class we paired up with the person next to us, trying to make their resume responsive. Once we finished one perosn's site, then we worked on the other perosn site. We did this up to the end of class. Before we left class, we discussed why we thought partner coding was better than coding by yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>Thursday, October 5<sup>th</sup> 2017-</strong> Professor Pricari cancelled class today.</li>
    <li><strong>Friday, October 6<sup>th</sup> 2017-</strong> Today was a fun coding day. Rafeal and I brought in treats for the class. He brought cookies and I brought lolipops. While we were embracing our sugar rushes, we watched 2 tech talks by Jerey and Zach. After they were both done, we had until 1:30pm to do some type of coding. At 1:30pm, we had another industrial presentation. Today we had Josh come in. He talked about:
    <ul>
      <li>His previous background</li>
      <li>His current job as a quality insurance.</li>
      <li>The hiring process. Exc...</li>
    </ul>
   Once he left, we went back to our individual coding. We continued to code until class ended. Today has been a good day.</li>
  </ul>
